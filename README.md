# 1TBA-project
This study focuses on the TATA-box binding, transcription initiation factor TFIID protein, 1TBA. Structural, sequence and machine learning algorithms-based analysis were employed to explore the evolutionary relationship of the TATA-box binding like protein, which involved identifying similarities with other known protein folds. To prove this evolutionary relationship, a support vector machine (SVM) based algorithm was developed as part of this analysis. The combined results from structural, sequence-based analysis and SVM-based algorithm led to the identification of several domain folds that are evolutionary related to TATA-box binding like protein (1TBA). Also we developed a method that will be an aid to identify new or related TATA-box binding protein-like (1TBA,B), such as Glutamine synthetase/guanido kinase (3JU6,B), LuxS, MPP, ThrRS/AlaRS common domain (3W3S,A), Thioesterase/thiol ester dehydrase-isomerase-like (4V12,A) and Tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis enzymes-like (5K95,B1).
